#### Java-based full-stack CICD pipeline spring boot
- pipeline was designed for automated builds, testing, security scanning, and deployment, ensuring high availability and reliability

1. Code Commit & Version Control:
     - Developers pushed code changes to GitHub.
     - Branching strategy: feature branches → develop → main.
2. Continuous Integration (CI):
     - Jenkins was triggered by a webhook on every new commit.
     - The pipeline performed:
          - Code Quality Checks: SonarQube for static code analysis.
          - Dependency Management: Maven for building the Java application.
          - Security Scanning: Trivy for container security, Snyk for dependency scanning.
          - Containerization: Docker to package the application into a container image.
          - Image Storage: The container was pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR).
3. Continuous Deployment (CD):
     - Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform managed AKS cluster provisioning.
     - Helm Charts: Defined application configuration and Kubernetes manifests.
     - Deployment Strategy:
          - Rolling Updates: Ensured zero downtime deployment.
          - Canary Deployment (if needed): Used for gradual rollout and monitoring.
     - Monitoring & Logging:
          - Prometheus & Grafana for application metrics.
          - Azure Monitor & Log Analytics for centralized logging.
4. Post-Deployment Validations:
     - Automated functional and integration tests using Selenium & JUnit.
     - Smoke testing to verify key application functionality.

- Technology Stack:
     - Application: Java (Spring Boot)
     - Containerization: Docker
     - CI/CD: Jenkins + GitHub
     - Security Scanning:
          - SonarQube (code quality),
          - Snyk (dependency scanning),
          - Trivy (container security)
     - Artifact Repository: Azure Container Registry (ACR)
     - Orchestration: Kubernetes (AKS)
     - IaC: Terraform (provisioning AKS)
     - Deployment: Helm (managing Kubernetes manifests)
     - Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, Azure Monitor

- Terraform Configuration for AKS & ACR
     - updating terraform/main.tf  we can provision an AKS cluster in Azure region and create an Azure Container Registry (ACR).
- Application Setup & Dockerfile
     - updating app/Dockerfile we can create Spring Boot Java application packaged into a Docker container
     - once image is created we can push the Build image into Azure Container Registry.
- Helm Chart for Kubernetes Deployment	
     - helm-chart/templates/deployment.yaml
     - helm-chart/templates/service.yaml
     - Deploy Helm Chart
- Jenkins Pipeline (CI/CD)
     - app/Jenkinsfile
- Security Scanning Configuration
     - SonarQube (app/sonar-project.properties)
     - Trivy (Container Security Scan)
     - Snyk (Dependency Scanning)
- Monitoring (Prometheus & Grafana)
     - Prometheus Config (monitoring/prometheus-config.yaml)
     - Deploy Monitoring using
          - kubectl apply -f monitoring/prometheus-config.yaml
          - kubectl apply -f monitoring/grafana-dashboard.yaml
