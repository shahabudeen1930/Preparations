#### Devops Role & Responsibilities

- Thanks for opportunity,
     - **Hi, i am ****** I have total 14+ Years of IT experience in which I have 6+ yrs of experience in SRE & on DevOps tools.** Network Operations Center
     - I have experience working with multiple cloud providers, AWS, Azure, and Oracle Cloud (OCI).
- I was responsible for:
     - I support various cloud services, Virtual Machines (VMs), EC2, VPC, VNet, IAM policy management, RBAC,  Route 53, DNS, EKS, AKS, Docker, Storage,.
     - **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation:** Designed and implemented a Jenkins, Azure pipelines, GitHub Actions/GitLab CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
     - **Deployment & Management:** Deployed and managed containerized applications using Kubernetes (EKS/AKS), Helm charts with proper RBAC and security policies.
     - Infrastructure Automation: Used Terraform & Ansible to provision and configure cloud resources and also used Shell/Bash Script for automating 
     - Monitoring & Alerting: monitoring infrastructure and applications continuously, Prometheus, Grafana, Azure Monitoring, CloudWatch, ELK Stack for real-time monitoring and proactive alerting.
     - Incident Management & RCA: Led blameless postmortems and SLO/SLI/SLA tracking to improve system reliability.
     - Security & Compliance: Implemented IAM, RBAC, network policies, vulnerability scanning, and secrets management using HashiCorp Vault.
     - In a Role of SRE : Cost Optimization: Leveraged autoscaling, Spot Instances, rightsizing, serverless patterns to optimize cloud usage and cost.
     - and as a system administration i have expreience in server provisioning, migrations, troubleshooting, Harware related and performance tuning.

#### Deployment of Applications
- yeah,  I’ve been actively involved in deploying various types of applications across different environments. I’ve handled deployments using Kubernetes (EKS/AKS) where I used Helm charts to package and deploy microservices. I’ve also worked with CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Azure Pipelines to automate the entire deployment process — from code commit to production release.
- In most cases, I’ve integrated proper testing, approvals, rollback strategies to ensure zero-downtime deployments. I’ve deployed containerized applications with proper RBAC, network policies, and monitoring integrations in place. Depending on the use case, I’ve also done blue-green and canary deployments to minimize risk.
- I ensure that deployments are automated, repeatable, and aligned with infrastructure and security best practices.

#### Deployment Strategies
- Topics
     - Blue-Green Deployments (Minimizes downtime)
     - Canary Deployments (Progressive rollout)
     - Rolling Updates (Zero-downtime upgrades)
     - Immutable Infrastructure (Terraform, Ansible)

#### Deployment steps
- I have deployed multiple web applications, including microservices-based applications on Kubernetes (EKS, AKS) and monolithic applications on VMs and containers. I automated deployments using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Terraform, implementing blue-green and canary deployments to ensure zero downtime.
- For monitoring and alerting, I set up Prometheus, Grafana, and ELK, integrating with Datadog for proactive monitoring. I also enforced Kubernetes security best practices, including RBAC, secrets management (Vault), and network policies.
- One of the key challenges I faced was a high-traffic application experiencing downtime during peak hours. I optimized autoscaling in EKS with HPA and VPA, reducing latency by 40% while ensuring cost efficiency.
- Additionally, I have worked on incident response and RCA processes, ensuring production stability by implementing self-healing mechanisms and automated rollback strategies.
